          <p style="color:rgba(255,255,255,0.75)"><br>I am a focused, detail-oriented, and organized Mechanical Engineering (major) and Computer Science (minor) student at The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art (2022) in New York City.
		  <br><br>
		  I am interested in computational mechanical engineering research. I spent the summer of 2021 as an undergraduate R&D intern at Sandia National Laboratories as one of only eighteen students in the Nonlinear Mechanics and Dynamics (NOMAD) Research Institute. There, I worked on FEA simulations (using Sierra/SM on Sandia’s HPC servers) to collect data that I later fit in Python using nonlinear least squares regression with an empirical puncture energy equation previously developed. As I did during my internship and also do in many of my mechanical engineering classes, I utilize Python and other programming languages to further develop the various projects I have worked on, writing programs to aid in optimization and simulation.
		  <br><br>
		  I hope to further develop both my mechanical engineering and computer science skills in a research environment. Some of my favorite required classes included: fluids, mechanics of materials, stress & applied elasticity, and heat transfer. I also took two graduate level electives, one on computer aided engineering (CAE) and another on computational fluid dynamics (CFD); those two electives were a combination of all my favorite required classes, included industry-standard FEA programs, and included the approach of fine-tuning complex designs based on the use of simulations. I would like to continue working and researching in the area of FEA, perfectly combining my mechanical engineering and computer science interests.
		  <br><br>
		  I also have experience in designing, analyzing, and manufacturing through my coursework as well as through my time on my school's Formula SAE team as the chief engineer (2020-2021), steering subsystem lead (2019-2020), and member of the vehicle dynamics subsystem (2018-2021).</p>

Working hands-on figuring out solutions and creating something is extremely educational and rewarding, whether the results turn out as expected or not. In this section, I share the various mechanical and electrical projects that I have worked on over the years. This includes projects for my mechanical engineering classes, my computer science classes, the Cooper Formula SAE team (that's me welding on the car!), and projects I worked on at home.

I have come a long way since my freshman year, now holding the elected position of Chief Engineer, charged with overseeing and verifying all design decisions and ensuring system integration and quality control for all components. Before becoming Chief Engineer, freshman year I joined the vehicle dynamics system and started learning a lot and working hard. I learned about different components, how they all fit and worked together, and helped with manufacturing, learning how to machine on the manual lathe and vertical mill and TIG weld. At the end of freshman year I took over the steering subsystem as the steering subsystem lead, charged with designing and manufacturing the steering of the car. I continued in that role through sophomore year. Being on the team has been an incredible opportunity to learn practical mechanical engineering skills. Although the in-person 2020 competition in Michigan was canceled due to COVID-19, an online competition was held where I presented the steering design to expert judges.

Before I started, I had no clue how they worked. This class was a graduate-level elective that I took at the end of my Junior because I wanted to learn about CFD solvers and how to use them. The professor for this class, liked giving projects that students did not know how to do when they started, so they could learn as much as possible along the way. My group and I started by reading papers on how axial compressors worked, and watching various videos we found online. We slowly developed extensive Excel spreadsheets that detailed our calculations for the design. We validated and adjusted our design based on the many CFD simulations we ran in <b><a href="https://www.ansys.com/products/fluids/ansys-fluent">Ansys Fluent</a></b>. In the end, we were able to write an over 40 page technical report describing the design, the calculations, and simulation results we used to validate our decisions. Overall, it was an incredible learning opportunity that gave me more confidence in approaching and tackling problems I had never seen before.</p>

Although the numerical methods class was specifically for chemical engineers (the class was formally called <i>Process Simulation and Mathematical Techniques for Chemical Engineers</i>), the topics were widely applicable. In this class, we learned about numerical error inherent in all calculations and computer simulations, how to avoid and quantify these errors, and how to use various numerical methods to: solve equations, interpolate & extrapolate data, perform numerical differentiation & integration, solve IVPs, systems of nonlinear equations (SNLEs), BVPs, & PDEs, and solve problems iteratively. The class was taught using Python, my favorite programming language, where we learned how to write our own functions and use the functions found in various modules, such as <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NumPy">NumPy</a></b> and <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SciPy">SciPy</a></b>. The final project was broken into 3 parts. The first part was to create functions that solved for the saturation pressure of 4 chemical species using provided data and provided the error on the results; I did this by fitting each species’ data with two overlapping exponential curves (the shape was dictated by the <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clausius%E2%80%93Clapeyron_relation">Clausius–Clapeyron relation</a></b>) that were fit by nonlinear regression. The second part was to create the functions that solved for the state of the flash tank unit given specific inputs, and we needed to use <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-finding_algorithms">root finding</a></b>, <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent#Solution_of_a_non-linear_system">gradient descent for SNLEs</a></b>, and <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method#Nonlinear_systems_of_equations">Newton’s method for SNLEs</a></b>.

A <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory">chaotic</a></b> system is one that is said to have a sensitive dependence on initial conditions. Meaning, a chaotic system would exponentially separate from the path taken by itself for initial conditions that are very similar. The professor and I are interested in seeing if chaotic motion would arise from a small mass (to the left, in my animation) being pulled by a very large mass (on the right, in my animation). The right mass is so massive that it feels no external forces and moves at constant velocity. Meanwhile, the left mass experiences periods of zero velocity while the spring is not exerting enough force to overcome static friction, and periods of motion where the left mass is moving closer to the right mass, which results in the spring being shortened and spring force being reduced until the kinetic friction and spring force equalize. The professor and I are still working on different models to assess the chaotic qualities of this system, but we have noticed that a difference in initial separations of 1e-6 results in a noticeable difference in the mass’s position at different time intervals compared to itself without that initial separation difference. <b><a href="https://youtu.be/fgTVcF3mN3A?t=39">Here</a></b> is an animation showing the separation difference as a result of the small change in initial conditions. <b><a href="https://youtu.be/y4yQ8tDE9ic">Here</a></b> is the full video of the animation shown on this page.

                      <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">Once again, a YouTube video was my inspiration for a project. I first heard about this method of calculating Pi from <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M34TO71SKGk">this</a></b> video. Given a circle inscribed in a square, if darts are randomly thrown at this "board", most will land in the circle, and some will land in the small region that the circle does not cover. Given the area of the circle is pi * radius^2, and the area of the square (whose side length would be 2 * radius if a circle is inscribed within it)is 4 * radius^2, the probability of a dart landing within the circle is pi * radius^2 / 4 * radius^2 = pi/4. Multiplying by 4, we can find the approximate value of Pi. With only a few darts thrown, the approximation for Pi would not be very close to the actual value. But after many darts are thrown, the value will get closer and closer. The code for this can be found on my GitHub <b><a href="https://github.com/jjacobowitz/PiApproximation">here</a></b>.</p>

                      <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">My mother loves gardening, but the animals were becoming too much. Where I live, we have: squirrels, chipmunks, rabbits, mice, raccoons, skunks, deer, foxes, and groundhogs. All these animals enjoy my mother’s vegetables as much as she does. So, during the summer of 2020 she asked for a fenced-in garden. I drew up some plans (see a photo of them <b><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s5vVlr4jvMBybIbBk8BTmBHu5Hv2pnKE/view?usp=sharing">here</a></b>) and bought all the materials with my father. Over the course of 5 days, my father and I built the garden. The garden has four 2"x8" planks that skirt the perimeter, making the 6'x10' base. There are seven 2"x4"x6' pieces that make up the vertical posts, all of which are dug half a foot into the ground. Connecting all the vertical supports are 1"x2"s. On the bottom we lay down ¼" hardware cloth (steel fencing that has ¼" holes) to keep animals from burrowing underneath. We then put down a tarp to prevent weeds and filled the garden with about 30 cubic feet of organic garden soil. Around the perimeter we stapled more ¼" hardware cloth to prevent animals from getting in. The perimeter fence extends 6' high to prevent deer from reaching over and feasting. The door is easily attached and removed with eye hooks and is also covered in 1/4" hardware cloth. So far the garden has kept out all animals, leaving the plants to grow freely.
